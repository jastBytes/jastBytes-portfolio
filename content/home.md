Hi! How's it going? I am Jan Steffen.

I used to live in [Limburg a.d. Lahn](https://goo.gl/maps/ezkdWwKV8Jtm3Yr79), a small city between Cologne and Frankfurt. From a small village called [Lindenholzhausen](https://goo.gl/maps/e9TT2jAN4orMK1wP8) to be specific.

In 2010 I moved to [Hamburg](https://goo.gl/maps/6MsYGWBC1B5SVmhW6) after I had finished studying computer science (`B.Sc.`) at the University of Applied Sciences Gie√üen ([THM](https://www.thm.de/)). In Hamburg I continued studying computer science (`M.Sc.`) at the University of Applied Sciences Hamburg ([HAW](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/)). Parallel I started working as a `Software Engineer` for different companies until this day.

In 2020 I've moved to [Frankfurt am Main](https://goo.gl/maps/gxKVGdKN24Mf8LV79), while keeping the job I had in Hamburg to that time. Now I'm closer to family and friends from the time before moving to Hamburg.

I work as a `Senior Cloud Engineer` @ [finleap connect GmbH](https://connect.finleap.com/) focused on cloud computing in the highly regulated field of finance.

In my free time I like to travel, making music, skiing and photography (see the pictures on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/iss0iss0/)).
